## Milestone 2

**NOTE:** Before running the parse and insert script, you need to first create a database called 'milestone2' and create the tables outlined in [TeamBeachHouse_RELATIONS_v2.sql](DBSchema/TeamBeachHouse_RELATIONS_v2.sql)

**NOTE:** Before running the script make sure you download the [Yelp Dataset](https://github.com/WSU-CptS451-Spring2022/YelpDataset/) and create a folder called 'YelpDataset' in root folder.

The parse and insert script will take several minutes to run
